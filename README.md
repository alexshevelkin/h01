Supporting files, in .zip or original format, for individual scripts are included in the repository, or if large, within a publically-available google cloud storage repository, as indicated in the script in question. 

Several scripts use google cloud BigQuery databases which are not publicly available and require a credentials file to access. However, the data contained within these databases is freely available for download from http://h01-release.storage.googleapis.com/data.html.
